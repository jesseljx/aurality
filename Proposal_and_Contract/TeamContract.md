# Team Contract Requirements

## What are the goals of our team?
1. Good experience with collaborative development tools like Github.
2. Get experienced with using git, terminal, and VS Code with git
3. Learn how the Agile workflow works in practice, and more generally, how to organize software development effectively.
4. Learn how to code in html, css, and javascript.
5. Hopefully learn a bit about how to create a user-friendly interface

## What are the strengths of our team and its members?
1. River strengths
    - Working with APIs
    - Basic Python scripting and working with SSH.
    - Working with JSON
    - Working with regular expression
    - Working with image recognition
    - Terminal-based programming (Unix)

    River weaknesses
    - Recursion in general.
    - No CSS or HTML knowledge.


2. Jesse strengths
    - Writes organized code
    - PostgreSQL (intermediate)
    - Python (small-scale programs and DSA)
    - OOP (large scale Java programs)
    - HTML (beginner)

    Jesse weaknesses
    - Lack of Python experience
        - Large scale programs
        - Classes (more familiar with Java for OOP)
    - No CSS and JavaScript knowledge
3. Klaus strengths
    - Python, C++, Java, Github, Scheme

    Klaus weaknesses
    - No frontend experience

4. Prompt strengths
    - PostgreSQL, python, C, R
    - bug fixing (I think)
    - regex
    - I/O multiplexing (in C). 
    - It’s been a long time since I used OOP, but I think I can manage. I believe I can find answers easily. Also pretty decent at Unix.

    Prompt weaknesses
    - no frontend experience
    - limited experience with html and javascript, much less CSS. 
    - Bitwise operations feel awkward


## How will we capitalize on the strengths of each member?

We will delegate weaknesses and give projects to people with strengths, keeping in mind that people who are not good at something should at least get to learn that thing.

## Team expectations

### Meetings: 
- Sunday 1-3.30pm, and all class meetings. In Anderson 329.
### Roles
- It’s quite decentralised right now, but that might change in the future if circumstances require it. I did a lot of check-ins where I asked people if they had any feedback or concerns about the current status of our work. I guess I could be the person who keeps track of where we are in our workflow, and initiate discussions about diving up work (Prompt)
- I am good with setting meetings (Jesse)

### Communication

- for now we are using messenger for all online communication, but we are also considering slack or some thread-based discussion platform if we need to differentiate between discussion topics.

### How will you make sure communication stays respectful? How does your team define “respectful”?

- Not dismissive of other people’s concerns
- Listening to and considering all ideas even if they seem far-reaching or unreasonable

### What are the expectations for dealing with a teammate who hasn’t been communicating? How frequently should team members communicate / check in?

- Check in with them and ask how they are doing/ if there’s anything we can help them with, and also ask them to turn on their notifications

### Technologies: What technologies will you use to support team meetings and work?

- Zoom/google meets if necessary, but IRL meetings are preferred.

### Decision-Making: How will you make decisions? (Unanimous, consensus, majority rule, by assigned roles, rock-paper-scissors, etc.)

- Hear the arguments from all sides then consensus ranking

### Delegation:

- How will you divide the work?
    - At this point, we have no idea of the specifics yet. It really depends on what the next task is.
- How will you ensure that everybody participates meaningfully? How will you make sure that everyone’s contribution is valued?
    - Make a google doc where everyone gets to list their plans for the next few days, so we can make adjustments if there's an imbalance of workload
    - Acknowledging their contribution and complimenting their efforts.

### Conflict Resolution:

#### What expectations do you have for satisfactory participation? (e.g. time, contributions)
- Ideally, everyone meets on time, and accomplised what they planned.

#### What process will you follow if someone does not live up to their responsibilities and/or meet the standards for work set by the team?
- Talk to them about it but also try to be understanding if extenuating circumstances arise → light warning, like, we’re gonna write about this on the reflection form?? → talk to prof.

#### How will you address conflict or deal with disagreements within the team?

- If the conflict does not involve the entire team, find a non-involved team member to be the mediator who tries to understand both sides of the conflict and then offer a way forward.
- If it does, then we could agree to vote.
